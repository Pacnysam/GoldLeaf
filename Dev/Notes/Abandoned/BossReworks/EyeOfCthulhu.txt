eye of cthulhu rework
expected gear: late ore sets, heart set, hermes boots, bottle accessories

goals: make more fun and interesting, MAKE EXPERT FAIR, make true melee friendly
-doesnt do contact damage unless dashing

AI:
-dashes 3 times in a row between every attack, light anticipation, second phase dashes twice in sets of 2
-floats above you and spins around spawning some tiny eyes, small eyes shift around before dashing all at the same time (dont do contact damage until the dash) in phase 2, 
-in phase 2, shoots a few tears (beams?) that speed up over time (similar to demon scythes but more even)

phase 2:
-EoC will dash at you shortly after the eyes do 

expert mode:
-final dash curves toward you a bit
-shoots a volley of tears instead of only 1, acceleration is increased

new drops:
-replacing/reworking shield of cthulhu: short 2 directional dash with invincibility tied to a hotkey. expert mode enchants it, reducing cooldown and dealing damage while traveling
