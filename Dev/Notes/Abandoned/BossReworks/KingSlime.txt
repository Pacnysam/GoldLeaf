king slime rework
expected gear: wood/early ore armor, early class weapons, cloud in a bottle

goals: make fight faster, remove annoying quirks. make true melee friendly
-does not spawn slimes on hit, lower hp
-long-ish delay between attacks
-horizontal movement is slower, does not speed up when losing health
-telegraph teleporting, teleports further from you, and more often

AI:
-movement pattern is 2 small jumps then a large one, creating a small shockwave on landing
-sometimes shoots 3 slime blobs in a mortar pattern, can be dodged by standing between them or moving close to KS, does not continue moving until projectiles die
-going too high above it will increase defense and spawn slimes
-crown gem can charge up and make a small light explosion around KS when too close, shoots small light beams if too far

expert mode:
-shockwaves sweep the ground
-slime mortar shoots 5 projectiles instead of 3
-gem explosion is bigger and beams are faster
