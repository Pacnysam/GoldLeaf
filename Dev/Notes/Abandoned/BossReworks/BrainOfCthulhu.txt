brain of cthulhu rework
expected gear: heart and blizzard sets, dash, hermes boots, balloon accessories

goals: remove the shitty debuffs, make both phases more interesting, give each one more distinct attacks
-has 11 creepers surrounding it, killing them all puts the boss into phase 2

AI:
-in between every attack; 3 creepers dash at you, then brain does
-creepers form a ring around BoC and shoots away from it, very slowly moves toward you during this
-places targets over the area around you, sending up to 6 creepers at each one; once all fired they get recalled all at once

phase 2: 
-in between every attack; teleports away then reappears and dashes at you, firing a few projectiles perpendicularly to it; speeds up overtime like demon scythes
-teleports around you 2-3 times shooting a bolt at you each time; then shoots a solid beam toward you
-shoots bolts in all 8 directions, then they return to it

expert mode:
-creeper ring alternates between shooting away from BoC and shooting toward you
-creeper target is able to shoot all 11 creepers
-occasionally in phase 2, it will place a shadow over itself, hitting it during this time will heal it by 160, confuse you for a short while and teleport away

new drops:
-brain of confusion rework, avoiding damage for a short period will make you dodge the next attack and confuse nearby enemies
-summon weapon?
