almost all heaven's gate content is LONG gone and not even being considered, from oldest to newest this includes:
-heaven's gate event [poorly thought out bloat
-alchemist class and all related item sets (royal jelly, heartstone, aerogel, watcher) [bad idea, bloat
-all boss reworks and related item sets (oil, biopunk, magitech) [way too large scale for me
-alchemy abomination/rift boss [poorly thought out, overly complex bloat
-misc earlygame items (web cannon, 8 ball, glass cannon, etc) [overly gimmicky bloat
-summoner runes [not fun to use, nor easy to balance
-pandora's box event [way too complex, poorly thought out, not experienced enough, 
-ore set reworks [overly complex bloat
-blood moon rework [1.4 threw a wrench in this
-surface desert and snow reworks [not an experienced enough programmer for this, more on this later
-mimic, heretic and scrap collector npcs [pointless bloat

the only heaven's gate content that i might revisit (with major reworks), from least to most likely this includes:
-dry/temperate forest biomes [interesting and very fun idea but far too large of a scope than i can manage
-desert and snow outposts [the only part of the surface reworks that are possible, VERY low priority though
-misc earlygame items (nemesis, aurora, etc) [would need major reworks

old gold leaf content is most likely staying, from least to most likely this includes:
-secret vaults/special chests [neat idea but overly complex
-toxin grove [i adore the idea but can never find a place for it, thematic overlap with corruption, possible bloat
-surface dungeon items (runestone items and ghost bottle) [partially completed, but low priority
-prehardmode sandstorm content/sunstone [really cool but overly complex for it's point in progression

content that is in the works currently, from lowest to highest priority this includes:
-granite enemies [im inexperienced with NPCs
-misc earlygame items (paperweight, granite ward, etc) [getting reworks, should be simple
-blizzard and nightshade item sets [getting major reworks but ideas are fun and fill progression gaps
-whispering grove biome [literally what the mod is named after
