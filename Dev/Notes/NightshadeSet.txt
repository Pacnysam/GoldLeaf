Nightshade Set
post skeletron, should look and feel like dark magic and clockwork but with extra grunge
multiclassing is encouraged, being considered "taboo" to an extent only serves to reinforce the witchy theming
nightshade mechanic makes players choose between power and survival, while letting a very skilled player have both
keeping high nightshade improves power and reliability while maintaining low nightshade provides extra utility and safety
obtained late prehardmode, stays strong until early hardmode, a very good player can find them useful for much longer

Nightshade:
-NOT A BUFF, stacks up to 12, damage increases and defense decreases with every stack, fades over time

vampire bat: - Ranged Weapon
basic weapon with solid damage, serves to introduce mechanics and bring the whole kit together
-hits give you a stack of nightshade, right clicking shoots a bolt that heals you for each stack, but removes all of them

nox gauntlets: - Hybrid Weapon
should be the thing to really push the multiclassing aspect, very high damage but risky to use
-left click to punch; a slow, powerful, high knockback attack providing 2 nightshade each hit; does melee damage
-hold right mouse to briefly sustain a void, soaking up damage and gaining capacity for each stack of nightshade
-after cancelling or reaching capacity, left click to launch the void

witness: - Minion
doesnt have a way to increase nightshade on its own, requires using weapons of other classes
-locks onto an enemy and shoots inaccurate projectiles, locked on enemies do not deal contact damage
-every stack of nightshade closes its eye a little bit, slowly increasing contact damage to normal levels while growing more accurate
-at 12 nightshade they will stick to the player and psychicly damage enemies in range

venus pocketwatch: - Magic Weapon
supplimental item, main multiclasser role given back to nox; primarily supports vampire bat healing
-shoots a clock hand that slowly bleeds an enemy, sucking nightshade each time
-right click to rip it out doing damage and returing to you, increasing self healing by 20%, duration determined by nightshade

nightshade syringe: - Health Potion
might need some balancing, almost useless when used on its own; much, much better when used with nightshade set
-heals incrementally, getting damaged interrupts healing
-10hp for every stack of nightshade, provides 6 seconds of nightshade sickness for every stack
-nightshade sickness functions like potion sickness but also disables natural healing
